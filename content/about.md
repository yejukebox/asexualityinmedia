## About Asexuality in Media

Welcome to our comprehensive catalog of asexual characters in television and film. This project aims to document and celebrate asexual representation across various media, helping viewers discover shows and films featuring ace characters.

### What is Asexuality?

Asexuality is a sexual orientation characterized by a lack of sexual attraction to others. Asexual people (often called "ace") may still experience romantic attraction, and the asexual spectrum includes a wide range of identities and experiences.

### Our Mission

This website serves to:

- **Document** asexual characters in television and film
- **Visualize** representation across different genres, languages, and time periods
- **Evaluate** the quality of representation through community feedback
- **Educate** viewers about asexual characters and storylines

### Explicit vs. Implicit Representation

We categorize characters into two types:

- **Explicit**: Characters who explicitly identify as asexual in the show/film, either through dialogue, creator confirmation, or clear narrative elements.
- **Implicit**: Characters whose portrayal and character traits suggest asexual representation, though not explicitly stated. This includes characters who show no sexual or romantic interest, or whose stories align with asexual experiences.

### How to Use This Site

1. **Explore the Visualization**: Use our interactive scatter plot to browse characters by year, genre, and language
2. **Filter**: Narrow down characters by specific criteria
3. **Learn More**: Click on any character to see detailed information
4. **Provide Feedback**: Use the comment system to share your thoughts on representation quality
5. **Contribute**: Submit new characters through our contribution form

### Community Guidelines

When commenting on characters:
- Be respectful of different interpretations
- Provide context and evidence for your opinions
- Remember that representation matters to real people
- Avoid spoilers without warnings
- Celebrate good representation and constructively discuss improvements
